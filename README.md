Scry demo


Some things we need to:

* Add 'links' tab to events.
  * Make it look pretty.
  
* Put the information about relationships among agents in a file, and write the necessary function(s) to read such file. 

* I'd love to try putting this into an actual server. I like to try with Gcloud. Not necessary, but I'd like to try that out.

* I wonder what exactly we are planning to do in terms of user capabilities... what's the full vision on that. We haven't talked about that too much.
