# Constantine (Scry Demo)

**Attention:** This repository is no longer being actively developed. Instead, you can find my current project, Scry, at [github.com/henryhill1999/scry](https://github.com/henryhill1999/scry).

**_Constantine:_** From Rome to Byzantium is leaflet-based web application which showcases an interactive historical narrative. Constantine is built with Scry, a technology which visualizes the causal linkage between historical events, which can then be explored at the discretion of the user.

You can try a living prototype of this application at [https://constantine-prototype-1.appspot.com/](https://constantine-prototype-1.appspot.com/).
